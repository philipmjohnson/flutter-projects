# APOD 1

This is the final version of the code from the first week of the Flutter Apprentice Book Club.

It is intended to provide a second example of the concepts discussed in Chapters 1 and 2 of Flutter Apprentice.

To listen to a run-through of this code, see:

Start at minute 59, goes to about 1:12.

Goes over:
* Scaffold
* SafeArea (wraps body of Scaffold to avoid notch etc)
* ListView.builder (dynamically build list entries when in view)
* GestureDetector + Navigator + MaterialPageRoute to do navigation on click.
  * Page is built when the user actually navigates to it.
* Each "page" starts with a Scaffold (so the App bar is always there).
